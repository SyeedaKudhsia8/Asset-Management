# 🏢 Real Estate Asset Management - EDA & Visualization

Welcome to the **Real Estate Asset Management** project — where raw property data transforms into actionable business insights. This project dives deep into the exploration and visualization of real estate data using **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)** and **Tableau**.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset of managed properties, analyze key performance indicators like occupancy rates, and visualize trends that inform better asset decisions.

Key objectives:
- Understand space utilization across property types
- Identify high-occupancy performers
- Detect underutilized properties
- Create visual dashboards for stakeholders

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset, stored in an Excel workbook, consists of two sheets:
- `Properties`: Details about each property (square footage, occupancy, etc.)
- `Property_Details`: Meta-info and additional classification

Columns include:
- `Property_ID`
- `Manager_ID`
- `Property_Type`
- `GLA_SqFt`
- `Occupied_SqFt`
- `Vacant_SqFt`
- `Occupancy_%`
- `Gross_Value`
- ...and more.

## 📈 Insights Generated

✨ Some of the key insights generated from this project:
- 📌 **Which property types have the highest and lowest occupancy?**
- 🔍 **Which properties are outperforming their comparable peers?**
- 📉 **Which types tend to have the most vacant space?**
- 🧠 **Manager-wise asset performance metrics**
